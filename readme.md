## Introduction
This project was done as part of Udacity's front end web development Nanodegree.
It was my first real effort at using javascript in a website. I decided to design
the website by myself to gain some practice with software such as Figma and
understand how a design can turn into a website. The site is not fully functional,
it lacks responsiveness and I am not fully satisfied with the design. Over the course
of the project, I realized how much developers use JQuery, and how much easier it makes
coding in JS. That is the next step.

## <a name="index.html"></a>index.html
This file is the structure for the website. It lays out the sections, images, and majority
of the content. Originally, I had written in the navigation menu, however, I was challenged
to dynamically create one with JS and modeled the way that function works on
the original NavBar written in HTML.

## <a name="styles.js"></a>styles.css
This serves to provide styles to the entire page. I have broken it down into two other
files (both imported into this document). I find it convenient to separate my styles
as blocks and text. There are a few instances of animations and transitions that I
have used instead of JS because it just didn't seem practical to code functions for
simple commands like fades.

## <a name="app.js"></a>app.js
The most difficult part of this project was the JS portion. I struggled with various
functions and constantly encountered issues. Through much research and patience, I
eventually got the page to a point that I am proud of. There are three main functions
of this document: to create a NavBar, implement active sections, and scroll to a
section with the NavBar. As I stated before, this would be so much easier with a
knowledge of JQuery, but it was good practice to get a grip on how to work with
vanilla JS.
